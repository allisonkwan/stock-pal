## Running the App
This app uses Expo, a platform that simplifies React Native development. Official setup documentation can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/). To run Expo, you need:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): JS runtime environment
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable): package manager (could use npm instead if desired)
### On a Device
In the terminal, run
```
yarn start
```
To open the app:
- On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
- On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
### On Web
In the terminal, run
```
yarn web
```
This will redirect you to a new browser tab.
